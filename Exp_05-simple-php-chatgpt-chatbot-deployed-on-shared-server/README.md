## Exp_04 - Create a simple php chatgpt chatbot and deploy it on a shared server
<br>

### Objective

- Create a simple php chatgpt chatbot
- Deploy the chatbot on a Dreamhost shared server

### Notes
- In order to deploy a python chatbot one would need to rent a dedicated server and set it up.
- It's easier and much cheaper to set up things like domains and SSL certificates on a shared server than it is on a dedicated server.
- Python is not pre-intstalled on shared servers. Therefore PHP must be used to connect to the OpenAi API.
