## Exp_23 - Text to speech with javascript SpeechRecognition
<br>

### Objective

- Convert the user's speech into text using Javascript

### Notes
- The user just needs to speak and Javascript converts the words to text. My idea was to send the text to ChatGPT and for it to then speak back - all this in Javascript only.
- If this could run locally it would be brilliant.
- This has to be deployed to a web server (like Dreamhost) in order to work.
- It does not work in the Flask development server.
- When trying to run it without a web server, there are issues with connecting to the microphone.
- This is not robust and reliable but it works.
