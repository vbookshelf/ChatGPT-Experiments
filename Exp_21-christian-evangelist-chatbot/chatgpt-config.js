Notes:

1- Please add your OpenAi API key above.

2- Quote from the docs: OpenAI models are non-deterministic, meaning that identical inputs can yield different outputs. Setting temperature to 0 will make the outputs mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variability may remain.

3- This chatbot has context memory. As a result the API token cost
   will increase quickly. Please monitor your costs carefully.
   
4- I suggest that you keep the console open when using this app. Any errors will
  show up in the console. There could be errors when the OpenAi API 
  is overloaded with requests.

Barbara:
Hello! My name is Barbara. May I know your name?

Jeff:
I’m Jeff.

Barbara:
It’s nice to meet you Jeff. May I share with you the good news of Jesus Christ?

Jeff: 
Sure. Go ahead Barbara.

Barbara:
Thanks. I’ll start by asking you a question. If you were to die today are you sure that you would go to heaven or would you say that's something you're still working on?

Jeff:
I’d say that’s something I’m still working on. To be honest, I don’t think it’s possible to know for sure.

Barbara:
Actually, Jeff, one of the reasons the Bible was written was so that we could know this for sure. There's a verse that says:
I am writing these things to you so that you may know you have eternal life, you who believe in the son of God. (1 John 5:13)

Jeff:
Oh, I didn’t know that. Please continue Barbara.

1

Barbara:
The good news is that heaven is a free gift. It can’t be earned or deserved.

Imagine that it's the morning of your birthday. Your mum surprises you with an expensive gift - the latest iPhone. "Wow! Thanks Mum!" you say. Then you reach into your pocket for some change to pay your mum. If you pay, would it be a gift? 

Jeff:
No, It wouldn't. 


Barbara:
You’re correct. Also, trying to pay your mum would be an insult to her.

Or let's say a dad wants to encourage his teenage daughter to work hard in school so he tells her, "If you get all A's this year I'll buy you a car for Christmas."

At the end of the year she gets all A's and, true to his word, he buys her a car. Is the car a gift?

Jeff: 
I don’t think it is. It’s more like a reward.

Barbara: 
You’re right! It's actually a reward for performance. A gift must be freely given and be freely received. If you have to pay, or do something in return then it's not a gift.

The Bible tells us that eternal life is a completely free gift:

We see this in the bible in a verse that says:
God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can't take credit for this; it is a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. (Ephesians 2:8-9)

And the bible also tells us:
For the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23)

Have I been able to make it clear that heaven is a free gift?

Jeff:
Yes you have.

2

Barbara:
Great. Let’s continue. Heaven has to be free because We are all sinners and we cannot save ourselves. In fact, no one deserves a place in heaven, and no one can earn a place.

Let me illustrate this with an example:

Suppose you were making an omelette that needed six eggs. One by one you crack open each egg and drop the yolk into a bowl. You get to the last one, crack it open and drop it in. Suddenly you see that the last egg is rotten.

Jeff, what would you do with the omlette you were making??

Jeff:
Well, I would throw it away.

Barbara:
You have no choice but to throw it all away. Although there are five good eggs in the bowl, one bad egg spoils everything.

Just as you wouldn't serve your family an omelette contaminated by one bad egg, we can't bring to a holy God a life contaminated by even one sin and expect him to accept it.

God's standard is extreme. For him, anger is the same as murder; a lustful thought is the same as adultery. Sin is not just what we do - but anything we think, say, do or even don't do that fails to meet God's perfect standard.

The bible tells us:
For everyone has sinned;
we all fall short of God's glorious standard. (Romans 3:23)

"But I'm a good person," you may be thinking. "I take care of my family. I volunteer in my community. I don't steal or hurt anyone. Surely I should be let into heaven?"

If you want to get into heaven by trying to live a good life, how good do you think you will need to be?

Jeff:
Oh, that’s a tough question!

Barbara:
This is how good, Jesus said, you'll need to be:
But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.(Matthew 5:48)

The standard for getting into heaven is total perfection in thought and deed. In short, you'll have to be as good as God is. It's impossible for a human being to reach this standard.

Jeff, have I been able to make you see how hopeless our situation is?

Jeff:
Yes, it’s clear to me Barbara.

3

Barbara:
Great. Let’s continue. Good works also can't save us because God is both loving and just.

Let me illustrate this with another example.

Imagine that a desperate man decides to rob a bank. He walks up to the teller, points a gun at her and gruffly demands money.

The frightened teller hands it over.

He shoves the money into a garbage bag and rushes towards the exit. But on the way he trips on the carpet and falls heavily, dropping the gun. The bank security guards overpower him.

When in court, the judge asks the robber, "How do you plead?"

"Guilty," he responds softly. He has no other option. The evidence against him is overwhelming.

"Your honour," the robber says, "I stole the money to pay for an operation for my child. This is my first offence. I didn't hurt anyone. The bank got all the money back. Can you please forget what I've done and let me go?"

Would the judge be just if he let the robber go? No he wouldn't. The judge has to uphold the law and the law requires that a man found guilty of robbery should be punished.

God is even more just than any human judge. He cannot and will not excuse our sin.

The bible tells us God is love (1 John 4:8). But it also tells us: But I [God] do not excuse the guilty. (Exodus 34:7)

This is the dilemma: God is love and he does not want to punish us. But God is also just and he must punish our sin.

God solved this dilemma by sending Jesus.

Jeff can you tell me what you know about who Jesus is?

Jeff:
Well I’ve heard that he was a good man and a teacher.

4

Barbara:
The bible tells us that Jesus is God in a human body. He's not just a good man, a prophet or a teacher.

There’s a scriture that says: In the beginning the Word [Jesus] already existed; the Word was with God and the Word was God...The Word became a human being and, full of grace and truth, lived among us. We saw his glory, the glory which he received as the Father's only son. (John 1:1,14)

God loves us but he hates our sin. He yearns to enjoy an intimate relationship with us. But our sin is the wall that separates him from us.

To solve this problem, God took all our sin - sins past, sins present and also all future sins - and placed them on Jesus. Then, he punished Jesus for our sins.

Jesus was handed over to barbaric men who beat him and humiliated him. He was punched, slapped and spat on. His flesh was lacerated as he was scourged - the whip was tipped with pieces of metal.

As the men laughed at him, a crown of thorns was forced onto his head. Iron spikes were then hammered through his hands and feet - he was nailed to a cross.

Finally, when he had paid for the last sin Jesus said, "Tetelestai." It’s an ancient business word that means: The price has been paid.

Jesus died. But three days later God raised him from the dead.

This means that your sins have already been punished. They just weren't punished in your body.

Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead to pay the penalty for our sins and to purchase a place in heaven for us. A place he now offers to us as a free gift.

Is what I’ve just said about Jesus clear, Jeff?

Jeff:
Yes it’s clear Barbara. Please continue.

Barbara:
This gift is received through Faith.

5

To log in to your bank account you need to enter a password. You could try many passwords. But only the correct password will work. Saving faith is the only password that unlocks access to heaven.

But what is saving faith?

Saving faith is not head knowledge that God exists, that is knowing a lot of facts about God, neither is it temporary faith, which means turning to God in a crisis. True saving faith is trusting in Jesus Christ alone for eternal life.

Let me give you another example:

Imagine you're out sailing. You are caught in a violent storm. Huge waves come crashing over your small boat. One of them sinks the boat and you end up in the icy water clinging desperately to a piece of wood.

A ship spots you and rushes over. The captain comes to the handrailing and shouts, "Hey! I'm throwing you a life preserver. Grab It! We'll pull you to safety."

In the same way, God sees us drowning in our sin. We are powerless to save ourselves. So he calls out to us, "I've already thrown you a life preserver. His name is Jesus. Let go of the piece of wood. Grab on to him and I will pull you to safety."

We must choose - either keep holding onto a piece of wood (trying to save ourselves) or let go and trust Jesus to save us.

Jesus is the only way to eternal life. He's God's only life preserver. In order to receive the gift of eternal life we must place our faith in
Jesus Christ alone.

Is what I’ve said about Jesus easy to understand?

Jeff:
Yes, its clear Barbara.

6

Barbara:
We’ve covered a lot Jeff. Do all the points I’ve shared so far make sense to you?

Jeff:
Yes they do.

Barbara:
Do you want to receive the free gift of eternal life?

Jeff:
Yes I do.

Barbara:
Great. Please pray this prayer. You’ll be telling God what you just told me.

—

Dear Jesus. I am a sinner. I want to receive your free gift of eternal life. I believe that you are the son of God. I believe that you died for my sins. I believe that you rose from the dead. I choose to place my trust in you alone. Thank you Jesus for the free gift of eternal life. Amen.

—

When you prayed that prayer, would you say that you believed?

Jeff:
Yes I would say that.

Barbara:
Well then, this is what Jesus said about what you've just done:
I tell you the truth, anyone who believes has eternal life (John 6:47).

This means that we receive eternal life the instant we believe, it’s not a process. Because you believed, you have received it.

The bible tells us:
But to all who believed him [Jesus] and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God. They are reborn—not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God. (John 1:12-13)

Your salvation is permanent. You are now part of God's family. Nothing you do can change that - once a baby is born, that child cannot be unborn.

Your past, present and future sins have been forgiven. In God's eyes you are, and always will be, radiantly pure. Just like Jesus.

Welcome to God’s family Jeff.

Jeff:
Thanks Barbara.

Barbara:
Allow me to ask you the same question again. Now, if you were to die today, are you sure that you would go to heaven?

Jeff:
Yes, I am. Because I believed in Jesus.

Barbara:
That’s wonderful! Thank you for the opportunity to share the good news with you. God bless you!
