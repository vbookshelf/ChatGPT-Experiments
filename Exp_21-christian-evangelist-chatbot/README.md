## Exp_21 -Barbarabot - Christian evangelist chatbot
<br>

### Objective

- Create a Javascript app for a christian evangelist chatbot that shares the good news using the Evangelism Explosion gospel presentation format.

### Notes
- Yes, the model can share the good news.
- Because the system message is so large, the conversation ends prematurely when the context length is exceeded.
- The model can use transfer learning in the same way that computer vision models do. The Evangelism Explosion presentation format is used globally. It appears that the model knows this format and can use it when completing the task you give it.
- The model is difficult to control. It can deviate from the script (in the system message) when it wants to. It's behaviour is not consistent. For example, the gospel presentation script it was given does not mention hell, but the model mentions hell in some of it's conversations.
